    <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Well seasoned (aka experienced) Senior Software Engineer specialized in full stack web application development. Having used numerous front-end libraries 
            (knockout.js, Angular.js, Angular, Backbone) as well as writing appropriate middleware and APIs to interface to backend logic (and no I don't mean tons 
            of T-SQL, Stored Procedures and other MSSQL dependent features, which I can do, I just don't feel that modern day applications need that legacy to attempt 
            to move forward given all the NO-SQL options available). I have experienced a wide variety of challenges over my career.
        </p>
        <p>
            From building the first successful production deployment of both hardware and software for the Professional Bull Riders first entry to live sports scoring 
            (back in 2010) to assisting US Figure Skating association as a contractor, to STARZ online programming guide, to CARS SASS platform proprietary use case for 
            asset recovery agents, I have a depth of hands-on knowledge through many verticals, including introducing a major government contractor to the Sencha UI system, 
            that at the time was still IE6 Compatible and performant per the requirements.
        </p>
        <p>I have directed teams, coached teams and have experience as a part of a team in many facets. I have many hobbies, including guitar, PC/Server building, and gardening. 
            My primary hobby at one time turned full time in 2021 during the pandemic, which was laser engraving and cutting services. Given the state of things at that time, it 
            was fitting to work from home after my contract was ended due to COVID, and my wife and I still do laser work as a fun side gig/hobby.
        </p>
        <p>I am most fluent in C#, JavaScrip, Angular.js and SQL, however it doesn't take me long to learn different tech at this point with the various experience I have gained over the span of my career.</p>
